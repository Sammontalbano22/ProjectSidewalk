# ProjectSidewalk

Contribution to an Open Source accessability called Project Sidewalk project in Partnership with Rochester Institute of Technology. API found here: https://sidewalk-sea.cs.washington.edu/api.This project not only introduced me to how code can be used for accessibility projects, but was also used by RIT in a dataset of Dijkstra implementations. This project was co-authored by Barret.Altman@du.edu. **Note that this is a contribution to open source code and not exclusively our work.**
